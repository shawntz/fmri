Analytics and Data Collection
------------------------------

This documentation website uses **Seline** (https://app.seline.com/) for analytics tracking to help us understand how the documentation is being used and to improve its content and usability.

What We Collect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you visit this documentation site, Seline may collect the following information:

- **Page views and navigation patterns**: Which pages you visit and how you navigate through the documentation
- **Timestamps**: When you access pages
- **Technical information**: Browser type, operating system, device type, and screen resolution
- **Referrer information**: The website or page that referred you to our documentation
- **Anonymized usage metrics**: Aggregated data about feature usage and documentation sections accessed

Purpose of Data Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We collect this information to:

- **Understand feature utilization**: Identify which documentation sections and features are most and least frequently accessed
- **Improve documentation quality**: Determine which pages may need clarification or expansion based on user behavior
- **Optimize user experience**: Understand navigation patterns to improve documentation structure and organization
- **Track adoption and reach**: Measure how the preprocessing template is being used across research communities

What We Do NOT Collect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Personal identifiable information (PII)**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or other personally identifying information
- **Research data**: We do not collect or access any of your fMRI data or research materials
- **Login credentials**: We do not track or store any authentication information
- **IP addresses**: Seline does not store full IP addresses; only anonymized location data (country/region level) may be collected

Data Privacy and Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All analytics data is processed by Seline's privacy-focused analytics platform
- Data is used exclusively for improving this documentation and understanding usage patterns
- We do not sell, share, or distribute analytics data to third parties
- Analytics data is retained in accordance with Seline's privacy policy

Opting Out
~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer not to be tracked by analytics:

1. **Browser extensions**: You can use browser extensions like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or similar ad/tracker blockers that will prevent the Seline script from loading
2. **Do Not Track**: Most modern browsers support Do Not Track (DNT) signals; while not all analytics services honor DNT, enabling it in your browser preferences may reduce tracking
3. **JavaScript blocking**: Disabling JavaScript in your browser will prevent the analytics script from executing, though this may impact documentation functionality

For Researchers and Institutional Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recognize that many users of this fMRI preprocessing template work in academic or research settings where data privacy and institutional policies are important considerations.

- This analytics tracking is applied only to the documentation website, not to any code you run or data you process
- No information about your research subjects, data, or institutional affiliations is collected
- The preprocessing template itself contains no tracking or telemetry—analytics apply only to this documentation site
