# Contributing to the SML fMRI Preprocessing Template

## Welcome!

Thank you for considering contributing to our lab's fMRI preprocessing pipeline. We created this template to be community-driven, as we believe the best preprocessing practices emerge from collective expertise and rigorous discussion.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Scientific Contributions
- [ ] Identify potential issues in preprocessing steps
- [ ] Suggest improvements based on recent literature
- [ ] Share knowledge about best practices
- [ ] Question assumptions in our implementation
- [ ] Propose new validation checks

### Technical Contributions
- [ ] Bug fixes
- [ ] Code optimization
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Example additions
- [ ] Test cases

## Contribution Process

1. **Start with an Issue**
   - Search existing issues first
   - Create a new issue to discuss your proposed changes
   - Wait for maintainer feedback before significant work

2. **Fork & Create Branch**
   - Fork the repository
   - Create a branch for your changes
   - Use clear branch names (e.g., `fix-fieldmap-volumes`, `improve-distortion-correction`)

3. **Make Changes**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments explaining preprocessing decisions
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Add tests if applicable

4. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Link related issues
   - Include scientific rationale for preprocessing changes
   - Add before/after examples if possible

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Scientific Validity**
   - Explain the scientific rationale for changes
   - Cite relevant literature
   - Describe impact on preprocessing quality

2. **Code Quality**
   - Follow Python (PEP 8) and Shell script conventions
   - Include comments explaining preprocessing decisions
   - Maintain existing error checking patterns
   - Add appropriate logging

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README (only if needed)
   - Add inline documentation
   - Update parameter descriptions
   - Include clear and generalizable examples

4. **Testing**
   - Add validation checks
   - Test with different data types
   - Verify BIDS compliance
   - Check edge cases

## Questions?

Feel free to:
- Open an issue for discussion
- Ask for clarification on existing issues
- Request more detailed contribution guidelines

We appreciate your help in maintaining high-quality preprocessing standards!

cheers,
shawn
